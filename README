Keene Electronics sell a little USB FM Transmitter, which works out of the box with linux, 
but the applet supplied to do the radio stuff only works with Windows.

Using Snoop USB for Windows XP and usbsnoop2libusb.pl, some code somebody wrote for the OWL,
, I reverse engineered most of the key functions, and this program attempts to control the FM
transmitter side of the device.

Compiling:

You need libusb and libusb-dev,

gcc -o keene keene.c -lusb

Using:

When you plug the device in, it presents as a composite device, one is the audio device,
the other a HID device. On one of my PC's the alsa control is set to 0 after the device is 
plugged in, set this to about 80, if FM is distorted try reducing this.

The program accepts one argument which is the FM transmitter frequency without decimal place,
e.g. 98.80 is 9880, execute the program like:

./keene 9880

When excuted the program will attempt to set the frequency as set, it will set the tx gain to
full, kick the device into stereo, and set it to use European FM, as such the frequencies available are
87.50 - 108.00 (8800 - 10800). The increments available are 0.05, if you call 8881 for example it will 
round to 88.80.

The USB ID of my device is 046d:0a0e, if yours is different then you'll need to change the source.

NOTE: This is very rough and ready. Use at your own risk.

TODO: 
Figure out how to run it as non-root
Allow configurable for not EU FM
